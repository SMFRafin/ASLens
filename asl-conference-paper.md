# Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition Using Computer Vision and Support Vector Machines

## Abstract
This paper presents ASLense, a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to translate hand gestures into text. The system employs MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, achieving real-time performance on consumer hardware. Our implementation includes a user-friendly graphical interface and demonstrates robust performance across different lighting conditions and hand positions. The system currently supports all 26 letters of the English alphabet and a space gesture, making it suitable for practical ASL communication applications.
